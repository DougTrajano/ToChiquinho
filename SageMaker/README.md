# SageMaker Custom DLC (Deep Learning Container)

This folder contains the code to build a custom DLC (Deep Learning Container) for SageMaker.

We are using a custom DLC to run our training and inference jobs. The custom DLC is based on the [PyTorch DLC]().

We extended the PyTorch DLC to include the additional python dependencies and [Git Large File Storage (LFS)](https://git-lfs.com/).
